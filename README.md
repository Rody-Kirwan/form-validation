# Sample Application

This is a sample application to display form management / validation solution using React component-state managment.

It was my decision to make any Redux implementation a low priority. i.e (Implement in redux if I have time). 
In my opnion form state should largely be ephemeral and is much simpler managed in component-state. For this project I tried to focus on building:

  - Solid scalable application foundation / file structure
  - A validation solution (that requires some work
  - A clear GIT commit history to make process as transparent as possible
  - And a final lightweight artifact

However I will branch from this to create a quick redux implementation as an example.

To run:
  - node => `npm start`
  - bash => `./build.sh && ./run.sh
